fraud or ginune using Machine learning algorithms  
step 1:-you need to install the required libraries to run the project  
  to install pyspark follow the commands shown in this webpage  
  https://medium.com/@GalarnykMichael/install-spark-on-windows-pyspark-4498a5d8d66c

##Crime Prediction   
  In this project we are to identify which method or algroithm is best suited to pred crime   
  we are comparing   
    KNN model  
    Decision Tree   
    Random Forest tree models  
    As data is provided in the project you can use it
    
    For running this project you have to install the following libraries
    Numpy
    pandas
    Matplotlib
    scikit
    seaborn
    
    to install use the following syntax in the command prompt
    
    pip install library_name
    
    Then run the ipynb file
###SET Vechicle Fine System  

  In this project we are going to detect and extract the number plate from image and  
  extract the text from the nummber plate and developted a small file system to post the fines
  
  to run you have to program you have to install the following libraries
  Numpy  
  Pandas  
  Matploatlib  
  Keras  \
  seaborn  
  Pillow
